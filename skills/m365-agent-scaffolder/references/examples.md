atk init my-project --template declarative-copilot

# ❌ WRONG - atk init does not exist
atk init my-project --template m365-agent

# ❌ WRONG - --template flag does not exist
atk new my-project --template anything

# ❌ WRONG - missing npx prefix
atk new -n my-project -c declarative-agent
```

## Example 4: Error - Non-Empty Directory

**User:** "Create a new project called expense-tracker"

**Directory check result:**
```bash
# Check directory is empty
ls -A
# Output shows: package.json  src/  README.md
```

**Error response:**
```
❌ Error: Current directory is not empty!

This skill requires an empty directory to scaffold a new M365 Copilot agent project.
Please navigate to an empty directory or create a new one first.
```

**Note:** The assistant STOPS here and does NOT proceed with scaffolding.

## Example 5: What NOT to Do

**User:** "Create a customer support agent with SharePoint and Teams capabilities"

**WRONG - Do NOT do this:**
```
❌ Creating TODO.md with architecture plans
❌ Discussing which capabilities to use
❌ Writing TypeSpec code
❌ Implementing agent instructions
❌ Opening workspace in VS Code
❌ Skipping the empty directory check
```

**CORRECT - Do this:**
```
✅ Check if directory is empty with ls -A
✅ Ask for project name if not provided
✅ Run: npx -p @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli@latest atk new -n customer-support-agent -c declarative-agent -with-plugin type-spec -i false
✅ Move files from subfolder to current directory
✅ Delete the empty subfolder
✅ Confirm creation in current directory
✅ Automatically invoke m365-agent-developer skill
